# NeteaseMusic-Playlist-Download-APP

Made in three days (2020.5.17-2020.5.20)

I made it for myself since:

(1) Some of my loved singers only had their songs published their songs on Netease.

(2) I don't want to subscribe the NeteaseMusic Month Membership for downloading only at max 300 songs for free in condition that I already have the Apple Music Membership.
